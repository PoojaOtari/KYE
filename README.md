The idea is to have a decentralised private ledger for all the organisation who can leverage it for performing employee background verification check instead of paying hefty amount to 3rd party companies (like FirstAdvantage) who does this on behalf of the requesting organisation. The way it works is whenever an employee leaves any organisation, that organisation can add a record to the blockchain with employee details like date of joining, date of leaving, his desgnation, relieving remarks etc... So now when the same employee joins some other organisation, the new organisation can query his complete employment track record from the blockchain and can validate it with the details the employee has provided. This will be much faster and cheaper than the existing background verification process. Linkedin can too leverage this blockchain ledger to show the authentic employement track of all its member.
